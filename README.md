# Demonstration-on-LFE-and-BLS

In short, the important point is :
X is input of training set, y is output of training set
mXr is the range of training set's input, mYr is the range of training set's output
mXc is the regular base width between the membership function, You may need to write the whole possible number within the range for it's input training set respectively, mYc is the center for output, same as mXc, you need to write in all possible number within the range, in my case i'm using range to auto-define instead of write in one by one.
mXint is the membership center interval for input, need to make change based on your requesting and dataset.
After we generate the LFE_INP.m, we can run the LFE.mat to training it.
